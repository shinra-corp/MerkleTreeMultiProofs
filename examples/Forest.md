# Using one commit that represent a Forest, not only a Tree

The idea is to have each leaf as a root to another tree.

The main take of this example is to show that we can construct from one tree many dimensional information by creating more subtrees.

From the library perspective is only one tree, and each node is just one hash.

He can build bigger trees by using the Generalized Index data.
